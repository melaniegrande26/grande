        <h2>A Tragic Tale of an Empty Bowl</h2>
        <p>In a shocking turn of events, local resident <strong>Mr. Whiskers</strong>, a 4-year-old Tabby, claims he has not been fed in "approximately one thousand years." This statement comes despite eyewitness accounts confirming he finished a bowl of premium tuna-flavored kibble exactly twelve minutes ago.</p>

        <p>Mr. Whiskers, speaking through a series of increasingly loud and dramatic meows, demonstrated the severity of his condition by showing his owners the <em>very bottom</em> of the ceramic bowl, which was clearly visible through a small gap in the biscuits.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "The situation is dire," his owner, Sarah, reported. "He has already collapsed twice onto my laptop keyboard while I was trying to work. He's currently looking at the refrigerator as if it contains the only hope for his survival."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Evidence of the 'Great Hunger'</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Intense staring at the cupboard door.</li>
            <li>Aggressive weaving between the legs of anyone walking toward the kitchen.</li>
            <li>A complete refusal to acknowledge the half-full bowl of water next to him.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At the time of reporting, Mr. Whiskers has decided to take a nap in a sunbeam, though experts suggest he will resume his protest the moment a can opener is heard anywhere in the tri-state area.</p>
